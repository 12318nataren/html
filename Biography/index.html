                        he was so impressed with Ada's analytical ability that he named her

                        in French on the Analytical Engine. Babbage enlisted Ada as the translator of the memory from French to English, and added a more voluminous set of notes from the original, which caused her to be considered 
                        the first female programmer in history.</div>
