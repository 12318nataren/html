                <h3>A Bit Of History</h3>
                <p>A Bit Of History
                    Hundreds of years ago, Playa del Carmen was an important Mayan stop along the pilgrimage route
                    toward the nearby island of Cozumel, considered a sacred place at the time.</p>
                <p>What we now call Playa del Carmen was once known as “Xaman-Ha,” which in Mayan means “waters of the
                    north”.</p>
                <p>Over the years, Playa, as it is commonly known, became a vital city of commerce and trade. Due to the
                    frequency of pilgrims, trade seekers, pirates and European explorers, the city flourished.</p>

                    Today, travelers and locals visit the city for relaxation, nature,
                    culture and a less expensive but no less beautiful travel destination than Cancun. Playa is said to

                <p>Is Playa Del Carmen Safe?
                    Playa Del Carmen is a generally safe destination for traveling in Mexico. Due to the large tourism
                    scene and a high number of travelers, petty theft and scams aren’t uncommon but aren’t a huge threat
                    either.</p>
                <p>What we now call Playa del Carmen was once known as “Xaman-Ha,” which in Mayan means “waters of the
                    north”.</p>

                <div class="text">
                    <p>Playa del Carmen is located on the eastern coast of the Yucatan
                        Peninsula on the Caribbean seashore. Located in the heart of the Riviera Maya coastal area,
                        Playa del Carmen is almost exactly in the middle
                        between the cities of Cancun and Tulum, just about 35 miles from each.</p>
                    <p>Playa del Carmen is also the jumping off point for Cozumel island, with ferries departing every
                        hour.</p>

                <h2>The Best Time to Visit Playa Del Carmen</h2>
                <p>The tropical climate in Playa Del Carmen is fairly predictable and easy to make
                    plans around. Without much of a temperature difference throughout the year,
                    (the average temperature lingers around 83° F)
                    it’s the rainy season that visitors should pay attention to.</p>

                <h3>January – April</h3>
                <p>The weather is picture perfect, but “peak season” means lots of
                    tourists and higher prices. The ocean, cenotes and
                    swimming pools (that aren’t heated) can still be a little chilly for some.</p>

                <p>The hottest and most rainy months of the year still offer plenty
                    of wonderful sunshine and fantastic warm water for snorkeling & diving.
                    The hurricane season peaks in September and October so keep an eye on the forecasts
                    and definitely get travel insurance just in case. Fewer tourists mean fewer
                    crowds and lower rates at hotels, resorts and tour companies during this time.</p>

                <p>Many consider the autumn-winter months to be the best time to visit Playa del Carmen.
                    The hurricane season has passed by this time, and the humidity is low.
                    It can be a little “cool” in the evenings so bring a warming layer.</p>
